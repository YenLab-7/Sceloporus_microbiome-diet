This repository contains the scripts of the manuscript Does diet modulate the composition of the intestinal microbiota of spiny lizards? In this research, we analyzed the gut microbiota variation between dry and rainy seasons across four Sceloporus species (S. aeneus, S. bicanthalis, S. grammicus and S. spinosus).
