# Sceloporus_microbiome-diet
This repository contains the scripts of the manuscript "Seasonal dietary changes relate to gut microbiota composition depending on the host species but do not correlate with gut microbiota diversity in arthropod-eating lizards" by Hern√°ndez et al.
In this paper we analyzed the gut microbiota variation between dry and rainy seasons across four Sceloporus species (S. aeneus, S. bicanthalis, S. grammicus and S. spinosus) from central Mexico in light of temporal changes in diet composition.
